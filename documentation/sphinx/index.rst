==========================
The |foxbms| Documentation
==========================

.. attention::

    - This is the documentation of the **first generation** of foxBMS
      (https://github.com/foxBMS/foxbms-1)
    - The **second generation** of foxBMS (foxBMS 2) is also found on Github
      (https://github.com/foxBMS/foxbms-2)

Welcome to the `foxBMS <https://www.foxbms.org/>`_ documentation of the first
modular open source BMS development platform from the `Fraunhofer IISB
<http://www.iisb.fraunhofer.de/>`_. |foxBMS| is a free, open and flexible
development environment to design state-of-the-art complex battery management
systems.

.. note::
    The present version of the |foxbms| Sphinx documentation is |version|. It
    is available in HTML
    at https://iisb-foxbms.iisb.fraunhofer.de/foxbms/gen1/docs/html/latest/.
    More detailed information on the version history can be found in the
    :ref:`general_information_releases` section. This documentation was
    generated on |timestamp|.


.. warning::
    The |foxbms| hardware and software is under permanent development. The free
    and open research and development platform |foxbms| as presented in the
    documentation hereafter is not provided to be used without any adaptions
    (e.g., to fulfill mandatory regulations) in consumer products, electric
    vehicles, production environments or any similar usages: it is only
    intended to be used by skilled professionals trained in designing battery
    system prototypes.


The documentation is divided in 4 parts:

 #. :ref:`general_information`
 #. :ref:`getting_started`
 #. :ref:`software_documentation`
 #. :ref:`hardware_documentation`

In the first part of the documentation, general information about |foxbms|
can be found (:ref:`general_information`):

 - Information about the versions and the related release notes of |foxbms|
 - Licenses of the hardware, software and document parts of |foxbms|
 - Motivation behind the |foxbms| initiative
 - Overview of the hardware and software of |foxbms|
 - Roadmap of the upcoming hardware and software components
 - Team involved in the development of |foxbms|

In the second part of the documentation, the :ref:`getting_started` guide can
be followed to commission |foxbms| rapidly. For getting |foxbms| desktop
software, obtaining and compiling the sources, and setting up a short test of
hard- and software the minium sections to be read are sections 1 to 4 of
:ref:`getting_started`

 - The location of the electronic schematic and layout files in the HTML
   documentation is indicated
 - The hardware guide describes how the hardware is structured and works
 - The software guide explains how to configure and flash the software
 - The CAN documentation shows how to communicate with the system via the CAN
   bus

To study and modify the software, the :ref:`software_documentation` presents
the structure of the software and of the most important modules, how the basic
tasks are running and how to call user-defined functions. Further, a FAQ is
provided to answers the most common questions. A detailed description of the
software functions and variables can be found in the |doxygen| documentation.

Finally, the :ref:`hardware_documentation` gives the details needed to
understand the |foxbms| hardware.
