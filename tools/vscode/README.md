# VS Code Settings

This directory contains a VS Code setup for development with the primary MCU.
The supported IDE for development with foxBMS is Eclipse. VS Code support is
experimental and should only be used in case the Eclipse setup does not work.

**This setup contains only settings for Windows.**

VS Code can be downloaded from
[code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The
[C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
is needed in order to have a good development experience.

- The license of VS Code can be found
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/license).
- The license of the C/C++ extension can be found
[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ms-vscode.cpptools/license).

The following steps are needed in order to work with VS Code:

- Copy the ``.vscode`` directory to root of the repository
- Change default shell to
  `"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\Sysnative\\cmd.exe",`
  or let the or let the ``settings.json`` edit your settings.

**Important**: This setup is configured for working with the primary MCU.
To work with the secondary MCU the file ``c_cpp_properties.json`` inside
``.vscode`` all references to the directory ``primary``/``mcu-primary`` must
be changed to ``secondary``/``mcu-secondary``.
